1-Car Class:
The Car class is a Dart representation of a car within the Flutter application. It defines essential properties such as title, details, imagePath, and backgroundColor, encapsulating key information about each car. The class includes a constructor that allows the creation of Car instances with specific attribute values. This provides a structured model for various cars within the application.

2-CarListScreen:
CarListScreen is a Flutter widget serving as a screen in the application. It displays a list of cars using instances of the CarItem widget. The screen follows Flutter's widget-based architecture, utilizing a Scaffold for layout structure. The app bar contains a title, and the body consists of a column containing CarItem widgets for individual cars and an additional image asset.

3-CarItem:
The CarItem widget represents an item in the car list. It extends StatelessWidget and takes a Car object as a parameter during instantiation. The visual representation includes a Container with a ListTile, displaying information about the car such as title, details, and an image. The background color of the Container corresponds to the car's backgroundColor. Tapping on a CarItem navigates the user to the CarDetailsScreen, providing detailed information about the selected car.

4-CarDetailsScreen:
CarDetailsScreen is a Flutter widget displaying detailed information about a specific car. It extends StatelessWidget and takes a Car object as a parameter, allowing access to the details of the selected car. The screen includes an app bar, a column with information about the car (title, image, specific details), and a UserDetailsForm for user interaction. This screen provides a comprehensive view of a selected car, incorporating both static and interactive elements.

5-CarSpecificInfo:
CarSpecificInfo is responsible for presenting specific details about a car within the CarDetailsScreen. It dynamically generates descriptive text based on the type of car selected (BMW i7 2023, Honda Civic 2021, Mercedes Antique E201). The widget takes a Car object as a parameter and uses conditional statements to determine the content of the specificInfo variable. This allows for a flexible and dynamic presentation of car-specific details within the app.

6-UserDetailsForm:
UserDetailsForm is a StatefulWidget capturing user information through a form. It includes fields for the user's name and phone number, a dropdown for selecting a country, and options for communication preferences (receive messages, subscribe to newsletter, receive promotional emails). The form is styled, and user input is validated. Upon submission, the user is navigated to the ConfirmScreen, passing entered details as parameters.

7-ConfirmScreen:
ConfirmScreen displays a confirmation message after user submission. It includes information about the user (name, phone number, selected country) and communication preferences. The screen is designed to be visually appealing, featuring a background image and a semi-transparent overlay. Depending on the completeness of user information, it either displays a confirmation message or an error message prompting the user to correct the input. The screen provides a smooth transition from user input to confirmation, contributing to a user-friendly experience.
